## An Analysis of crime in NYC

To identify root causes and predict crime in New York (5 boroughs)

Questions to answer

Can you predict a categorical type and severity of crime based on day of week, weather and location? (Log Regression, KNN, Decision Trees)
- Why is this useful: Can help provide information to residents about safety

What underlying demographic features (excluding race/ethnicity) are most heavily correlated crime (type and frequency)? (Log regression)
- Why is this useful: Can help provide local public organizations areas to improve (e.g. education, shelter, healthcare, jobs) 

Relationships of type/severity of crime with age groups and why? (Linear regression)
- Why is this useful: “Customer” segmentation to develop a targeted approach for action

##

Sprint 1: 
- For this submission, defined the question, introduced datasets and discussed initial observations
- 

Sprint 2: 
- For this submission, I used variables in the arrests data alone to see if we can predict the type of crime based on burrough, age group, sex and day of week. 
- Given this is a limited list of variables so did not expect a good result
- Next step would be to use the demographic data (now that we were able connect lat lon and community district) to see if the model can be more robust.
